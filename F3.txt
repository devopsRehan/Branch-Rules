On Windows, GitHub SSH keys can be created using the open-source tools PuttyGen and GitBash. On Ubuntu, or even on Windows with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) service installed, creating GitHub SSH keys is even easier. Simply invoke the ssh-keygen command in Windows PowerShell or the Ubuntu Terminal window.
