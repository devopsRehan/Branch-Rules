this step ensures that the user who manually triggers the workflow is listed as a valid QA user. If the user is valid, it prints a notice message indicating that the user is valid. If the user is invalid, it prints a warning message and exits the step with an error, preventing the workflow from proceeding further. This provides a way to restrict manual workflow triggers to authorized users.
