This step is responsible for performing the necessary checks when the workflow is manually triggered using the "workflow_dispatch" event. Let's break down the logic:

The step is conditional on the value of github.event_name. It only runs if the event that triggered the workflow is "workflow_dispatch". This means it will only execute when the workflow is manually triggered.

The environment variables QA_USER_LIST and GITHUB_ACTOR are set using the values of the QA_USER_NAME secret and github.actor, respectively. The QA_USER_NAME secret is expected to contain a list of valid QA users.

The script checks if the value of GITHUB_ACTOR (the user who initiated the workflow) is present in the QA_USER_LIST. It uses the grep command to search for an exact match of the user in the list. If the user is found in the list, it proceeds to the next step. If not, it prints a warning message "::warning :: Invalid User" and exits the step with an error (exit code 1).

The script checks if the branch being used for the manual run is "QA-Main". It compares the value of github.ref (the branch reference) with the string 'refs/heads/QA-Main'. If the branch is not 'QA-Main', it prints a warning message "::warning :: Invalid Branch Selected" and exits the step with an error.

If the user is valid and the branch is correct, it prints a notice message "::notice :: Valid Branch Selected" and continues to the next step in the workflow.

In summary, this step ensures that the workflow can only be manually triggered by users listed in the QA_USER_NAME secret, and the branch selected for the manual run must be "QA-Main". It provides an additional layer of validation and security to control who can initiate the deployment to the QA environment.
