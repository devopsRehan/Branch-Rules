Separate workflows in GitHub enable the implementation of multiple automated processes to deploy code to different environments. For instance, separate workflows can be created for each environment such as development, QA, UAT, and production.

Each workflow can have specific rules to trigger it based on certain events, such as code commits, pull requests, or other types of triggers. Furthermore, each workflow can be configured to use distinct environment-specific variables, secrets, and configuration files.

By utilizing separate workflows for each environment, it is possible to ensure that code is thoroughly tested and validated before deployment to each environment. Additionally, it facilitates the maintenance of a clear separation of concerns between different environments, making it simpler to troubleshoot issues and roll back changes if necessary.

For instance, if there is a development environment, a workflow could be created that builds and tests the code every time a commit is made to the development branch. Similarly, if there is a QA environment, a separate workflow could be established that builds and tests the code on the QA branch and deploys it to the QA environment once all tests have passed.

Overall, separate workflows provide an effective way to automate the deployment of code to different environments while retaining a high level of control and flexibility over the entire process.
