To set up separate workflows in GitHub for different environments, start by creating separate branches for each environment, such as "QA", "UAT", and "production". Then, create a separate workflow file for each environment in the repository's ".github/workflows" directory, specifying the branch to trigger the workflow in each file.

In each workflow file, define the steps of the workflow, including building and testing the code, deploying it to the environment, and running any necessary scripts. Make sure to configure the environment-specific variables and secrets that the workflow needs to run, such as API keys, credentials, and configuration files.

Using separate workflows for separate environments helps ensure that the code is thoroughly tested and validated before deployment. Additionally, it helps maintain a clear separation of concerns between different environments, making it easier to troubleshoot issues and roll back changes if necessary.
