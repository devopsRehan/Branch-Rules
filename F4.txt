GitHub Actions is a feature of GitHub that allows automating tasks and workflows for software development projects. With GitHub Actions, custom workflows can be defined that run automatically in response to events like code commits, pull requests, and issue updates. Workflows can include steps that build, test, deploy, and perform other tasks on code.
