GitHub Actions is a feature of GitHub that allows you to automate tasks and workflows for your software development projects. With GitHub Actions, you can define custom workflows that run automatically in response to events like code commits, pull requests, and issue updates. These workflows can include steps that build, test, deploy, and perform other tasks on your code.
