GitHub is a web-based platform that provides tools for version control and collaborative software development. It allows developers to host and share code, collaborate on projects, and track changes to code over time.

GitHub makes it easy for developers to work together on projects by providing features like pull requests, issues, and wikis. With pull requests, developers can propose changes to a codebase and request that they be merged in. Issues allow developers to track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks related to a project. Wikis can be used to document a project's code and processes.
